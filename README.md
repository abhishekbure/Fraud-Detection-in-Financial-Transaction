The **Fraud Detection in Financial Transaction** project focuses on identifying fraudulent activities in financial datasets using machine learning techniques. It employs supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on various features like transaction amount, time, and encoded account behavior. The project includes critical preprocessing steps like handling class imbalance with techniques such as SMOTE, normalizing feature distributions, and evaluating models using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to prioritize reducing false negatives. Implemented in Python with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this solution demonstrates a practical approach to tackling fraud in real-world financial systems. The project serves as a valuable tool for financial institutions to enhance security, reduce losses, and build trust with customers through intelligent fraud detection systems.
